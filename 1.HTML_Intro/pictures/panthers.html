                A black panther is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanism" rel="external" target="_blank">melanistic</a> colour variant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard" rel="external" target="_blank">leopard</a> (Panthera pardus) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar" rel="external" target="_blank">jaguar</a> (Panthera onca). Black panthers of both species have excess black pigments, but their typical rosettes are also present. They have been documented mostly in tropical forests, with black leopards in Kenya, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia and Java, and black jaguars of the Americas in Mexico, Panama, Costa Rica and Paraguay. Melanism is caused by a recessive allele in the leopard, and by a dominant allele in the jaguar.

                In 1801, Félix de Azara described a black jaguar observed by local people near the Paraná River in Paraguay.<sup>[28] </sup>In 2004, a female black jaguar was recorded in Mexico's Sierra Madre Occidental.<sup>[29]</sup> In 2009, a black jaguar was photographed by a camera trap for the first time in Costa Rica's Alberto Manuel Brenes Biological Reserve.<sup>[30] </sup>In Barbilla National Park, black jaguars were recorded in 2013.<sup>[31] </sup>In the mountains of the Cordillera de Talamanca, 104 records of jaguars were obtained between 2010 and 2019; 26 of them showed melanistic jaguars.<sup>[32]</sup> In eastern Panama, black jaguars were repeatedly photographed in the Mamoní River Valley between 2016 and 2018, mostly in primary forest.<sup>[33] </sup>Melanism in the jaguar is caused by deletions in the melanocortin 1 receptor gene and conferred by a dominant allele.<sup>[34]</sup>
